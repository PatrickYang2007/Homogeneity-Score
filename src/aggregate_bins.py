"""Testbed for the "summed-bin" idea.

The usual setup is one-region-one-score: a WINDOW-bp window centered on a single
16 bp region, labeled with that region's score. This script instead tiles each
chromosome into NON-overlapping WINDOW-bp bins:

    0-256, 256-512, 512-768, ...

For each bin it SUMS the scores of every 16 bp region whose center falls inside
it, and uses that sum as the label for the bin's 256 bp sequence. So one 256 bp
bin containing 16 regions becomes a single (sequence, summed_score) example.

Binning is O(n): each region computes its own bin id from its center
(center // WINDOW), then a groupby sums per bin. Input order does not matter and
there is no neighbor searching.

This is a separate, optional path. It writes data/{split}_agg{WINDOW}.parquet and
leaves the normal train/val/test{_w*}.parquet files untouched. Flip AGGREGATE in
train.py to train on these instead.

Note: the label is a SUM (range ~0..#regions_in_bin), so it is NOT bounded in
[0,1] like a per-region score. The model must be built with bounded=False so its
output is linear instead of sigmoid-squashed (train.py handles this when
AGGREGATE is on). No MACS2 peak filtering is applied here: the summation itself
downweights low-signal bins.
