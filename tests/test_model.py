"""Tests for HomogeneityScoreModel plumbing.

These don't test that the model *learns* (that's stochastic and slow); they pin
down the wiring that silently breaks training or checkpoint loading: output
shapes, the bounded/linear head, channel doubling, the configurable depth, the
depth-vs-length guard, and — critically after the block-loop refactor — that the
state_dict keys stay compatible with existing checkpoints.
